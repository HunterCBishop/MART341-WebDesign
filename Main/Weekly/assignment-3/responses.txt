An ip adress is simply a number that identifies your device to other devices. It allows for the easy back-and-forth
information flow required for most internet use. A DNS server can interpret your request of a domain name say www.youtube.com 
and then translate that request into the ip adress of the aformentioned site. If the DNS server doesnt have the ip adress of the 
domain name requested it will find a DNS server that does.
