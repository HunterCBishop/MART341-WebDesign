1) In CSS the universal selector is definately the simplest and least detailed option for selecting something, whereas an element <br/>
selector can be used to change just a single element of the page. Even beyond that is a class selector, able to choose multiple <br/> objects of the same class within an element. Tangentially, id selectors allow the selection of all objects with the id listed.<br/>
Each has a difinitive use case dependint on the scope you are attempting to adjust.

2) I didn't change my color palette from last weeks assinment because I feel I landed on something pretty nice. The cool colors<br/>
wont take away from the artwork I put on the page (once I put it there). Additionally the grey tone analagous blues are fairly <br/>
proffesional looking.

3) This week I just optimized some of my code from last week, adding some classes where I had previously been using id's. This <br/>
will help my work alot in the future I think.
