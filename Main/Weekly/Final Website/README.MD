Thanks for the awesome semester!
<br/>
<br/>
This was one of my favorite classes in my college career thus far. I loved the freedom of direction we were given, <br/>
and the direct access to information.<br/>
<br/>
I didnt itterate much for my final because I felt that I have a very solid base. <br/>
once I have more portfolio work to add the website will begin to feel more alive I feel like. <br/>
I made one piece of art for the main page though just so there would be something. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the awesome semester.<br/>
