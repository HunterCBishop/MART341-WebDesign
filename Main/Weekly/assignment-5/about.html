<p>
   <b><i>Heart of Darkness</i></b> was published in 1899 by Polish-English writer Joeseph Conrad. <br>
   The novel contains grueling testimates of human endurance and empathy as well as the terrible <br>
   toll of European imperialism in the 1800's. The vivid descriptions of the landscapes used thr-<br>
   oughout the novella create an incredible sense of despair and distrust that is juxtaposed by an urge to <br>
   dive further into the murky environment our lead describes.<br><br>
   It stands to be one of, if not the best of Conrad's works throughout his acclaimed catalogue.
