1) The goal of my website is to provide a compelling space to hold my artwork as a portfolio. I want it to be fairly minimal color wise, to allow for <br/>
my artwork to take center stage. I hope to make it simple to see my previous work to get them to consider a commission!
2) Responsive web design is important in that you never know what device or browser your user will be loggin in on. That way you can be assured <br/>
 people are always getting a good experience. I will most likely implement some of this next week.
