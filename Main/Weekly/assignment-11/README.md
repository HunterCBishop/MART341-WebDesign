1) Typface is the design of text. Its generally used interchangably with font but font is actually the file, while typeface<br/>
is the design itself.<br/>
<br/>
2) A fallback font allows a broweser to use a lower resource font in case one is loading slowly. Its good to plan this out <br/>
for the user's sake.<br/><br/>
3) System Fonts come pre-downloaded with an operating system, usually considered the web-safe fonts that most people can render quickly.<br/>
Web fonts however are fonts that are usually downloaded with a browser, therefor not all people may have them.
